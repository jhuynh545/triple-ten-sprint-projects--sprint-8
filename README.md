Beta Bank aims to reduce customer churn by predicting which clients are likely to leave. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, making accurate predictions crucial.

Using data on client behavior and past contract terminations, your task is to build a predictive model that achieves the highest possible F1 score, with a minimum threshold of 0.59 to pass the project. Additionally, you will evaluate the model using the AUC-ROC metric to compare its performance with the F1 score, ensuring a well-rounded assessment of its predictive capabilities.
